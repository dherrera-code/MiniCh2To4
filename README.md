Mini Challenge 4: 2-4 Endpoints

Description: This program has a web api with three endpoints that accepts two numbers and adds them, an endpoint that takes a name and time the user woke up and returns back the name and time in a sentence and an endpoint that takes two numbers and determines whether the first number is greater than, less than or equal to the second number and returns the result!

- Isaias Gonzalez: I had to update swagger to v9.* to get it to work. The endpoints work nicely, good job.
